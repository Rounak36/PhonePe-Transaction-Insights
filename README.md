# PhonePe Transaction Insights

## Project Overview

**PhonePe Transaction Insights** is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization project focused on understanding digital transaction behavior using real-time PhonePe data. The project explores transaction patterns, user engagement, and regional performance through SQL analysis, Python visualizations, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard. This end-to-end project demonstrates the integration of data engineering, analysis, and business intelligence to support strategic decisions in the digital payments ecosystem.

## Problem Statement

With the growing dependence on digital platforms like PhonePe, it becomes critical to understand the transaction dynamics across regions and categories. This project aims to answer key business questions such as:

- Which states and districts have the highest transaction volumes and user engagement?
- How are transaction behaviors changing over time?
- Which device brands or payment categories contribute most to the growth?
- What are the top-performing regions for user registration and insurance uptake?

---

## Project Objectives

- Extract and clean data from PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository.
- Perform SQL-based analysis on aggregated transaction and user data.
- Visualize key business metrics using Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations to improve business outcomes.
